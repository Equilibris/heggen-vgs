<!-- # Introduction + Purpose

We have decided to conduct a series of experiments surrounded the effectivity space of varius enzymes. The specific enzymes we decided to analyze were catalase and amylase, these catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, and the fission of polysaccharide to monosaccharides accordingly. -->

# Background theory

An enzyme is a protein structure, a polypeptide transformed and mapped by its shape to execute the desired task. The job of an enzyme is to reduce the required activation energy for the desired task. In other words: enzymes catalyze chemical reactions. The enzyme transforms a substrate into a product.

An enzyme achieves its desired effect through binding its substrate to its active sites, there are usually two active sites, the binding site and the catalytic site<sup>[[1]]</sup>. The binding site acts to attach the substrate and enzyme into an ES-Complex ( Enzyme-Substrate complex ). Once the ES-complex has been initialized the catalytic site will take action. This will be the action that reduces the activation energy; thenceforth leading to a successful reaction.

Here we can see the activation energy reduction graph with and without the prescience of an enzyme, as one can see the reaction is very dramatic.

Once the action of an enzyme has been invoked the enzyme will not simply dematerialize, nay, the enzyme will stay intact ready to process more substrate. Yet an enzyme’s reaction can still be inhibited. This can be done by something, rationally named, an inhibitor. Inhibitors can be broken down into two dual-archetypical sets. These are the sets of reversibility and competition.

Within the set of reversibility, we find reversible and irreversible inhibitors. Semantically named after the fact that irreversible inhibitors cannot be reversed, contrary to reversible inhibitors. Irreversible inhibitors usually function by changing the polarity of the active seat leading to the inability to construct an ES-complex. When it comes to explaining reversible inhibitors we need to dive into the other archetypical set: competition; of which there are two members, competitive and Uncompetitive enzymes<sup>\[Editors note: according to [2] there are four elements of this set\]</sup>. Competitive inhibitors fight with the substrate to attempt to construct an EI-Complex ( Enzyme-Inhibitor complex ) over an ES-complex. This means the inhibitor targets the active site and bonds to it. On the other hand, uncompetitive inhibitors do not seek to construct an EI-Complex, rather they will attempt to bond to another site, an allosteric site. This site’s primary purpose is to change the structure of the active sites to either constrict ES-complex construction or, in the case of ATP open for the possibility. NOTE: ATP is not an inhibitor, yet it uses an allosteric site to construct its ES-complex.

Chemical/biological inhibitors do not account for the only form of inhibition of enzymes. There are also PH and temperate optimums. These both evaluate to optimize the enzyme for action in their host, in our case, a mammalian host, human and bovine. If these conditions exceed specific limits the protein's structure will be undone. This is referred to as the denaturation of proteins. When one fries an egg the change in texture, colour, and flavour are products of the denaturation of the proteins in the egg. Denaturation affects the different levels of protein structure differently. For example, the quaternary structure can be destroyed, this may include complete dislocation of subunits whilst the primary polypeptide structure is seldom affected <sup>[[3]]</sup>. This can be displayed by the following graph:

Here one can see that an enzyme is most efficient at relatively high temperatures yet when operating at such temperatures one risks denaturation.

In other words: in experiments dealing with PH and temperature the lower the distance from the expected value in the host will lead to better results.

To sum up: the efficiency of the enzyme of choice varies dramatically with numerous environmental factors. These vary from the temperature and acidity/basicity of the system to the prescience of more complex chemical inhibitors like for example _Lead(II) nitrate_.

# Execution

## Amylase

### Experiment A;

1. Collect a few ml of saliva
2. Denote 11 test tubes $\{ 1,...,10,C \}$, supply them then with 1ml of your choice of PH7 solution, in our case, water. The test tube denoted C stands for control and will not be affected by the following steps
   1. Add 1ml spit to test tube 1
   2. Mix and transfer 1ml of the mixed solution over to test tube indexed n+1, this will lead to a concentration function of $t_n=2^{-n}$.

### Experiment B;

## Catalase

### Experiment &alpha;

### Experiment &beta;

# Result
