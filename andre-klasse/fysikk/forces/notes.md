$$N = kg~m/s^2$$

$$|F_vec|$$

is mesured in newton

two types of forces

1. contanct forces
2. distance forces

Example forces:

- The normal force acts on the object from the ground, this is a contact force since its in contact with the object, denoted (N_vec) `N_vec = cos(v) * G_vec`
- The gravitational force acts from the center of gravity of the object to the center of the gravitational attractor, denoted (G_vec)
