# A street cat named bob

<!-- friendship, self development -->

In the film _a street cat named bob_ we follow James and Bob the cat. It begins with a shot of James alone, in the middle of London. He is busking; trying to make ends meet. He then gains access to a methamphetamine-heroin hybrid. This as expected leads to an overdose where he then gets sent to hospital &mdash; drifting eerily close to the deep chasm of death. Yet James survives and following these events grows through his own willpower and the people around him to the best version of himself.

Post his overdose we get introduced to Val. Val and James seem to be acquaintances from one or more of James's previous overdoses. Following this, Val gets James a home, here he meets Bob. Bob is a stray cat that found James and decided to live with him, whilst not initially as James wishes for Bob to be free. They begin to seed a great friendship. This then grows throughout the runtime of the film &mdash; climaxing in Bob assisting James through the detoxication process of quitting drugs.

Yet Bob was not the one that did this &mdash; Bob was not the one that went through countless sleepless nights to save themselves from the dangers that are drug abuse. This was done by James. Therefore, this is a great story about self-development demonstrating the powers of manâ€™s psyche to light up their horizons for their greatest days to come. This film tells a story of tireless work, power, and dedication to strive for that that is great. In James case this is kicking his drug addiction. Throughout the recovery section of this motion picture we see the pain and suffering James had to endure to reach his goal. At a point considering re-entering the drug environment, remembering what he must do and keeps on pushing. Never again to even consider it. This shows just how far he has come.

Whilst the film has very sinister undertones it still does an outstanding job at creating a wonderful film retelling the powers of friendship and self-development in an exceptionally good manor.
