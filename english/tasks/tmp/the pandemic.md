# How is the Coronavirus outbreak affecting your life?

Discuss the present situation of the Coronavirus outbreak. How does it affect your life, and those around you; and how is society, on local/national/global level coping with this virus outbreak?

You should include two or more of the bulletpoints presented here:

- What weaknesses &mdash; and what strengths &mdash; is the coronavirus exposing in our society?
- What can we learn from this crisis? How should we apply what we’ve learned?
- What role, in your opinion, should leaders in government and elsewhere, play during a crisis like this one?
- What ethical issues does this pandemic raise? Both in terms of each of us personally, for our immediate communities and for us all as global citizens? What does it mean to be a “good citizen” in the context of this outbreak?
- What historical parallels, like to the 1918 flu pandemic and to the plague, can we find? And what can &mdash; and can’t &mdash; we learn from them?
- How can you best help yourself, your friends and family, or any other communities you’re a part of that are affected by this pandemic?
