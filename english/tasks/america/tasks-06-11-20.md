# task 1 reflect

## a

**Yes!** america has bullshit gun control that should be enhanced whilst New Zealand is much more thoughtful of their citizens.

## b

I think a dramatic movement requires a dramatic name. This is the only way you can react desensitized NRS

## c

No. We don't have to. We have a structured legal system designed so assist out citizens. Not systematically allow then to be killed.

# task 2 compare

## a

New Zealand has gun control; you cant kill someone with a gun if you don't have a gun.

## d
