# How english became a global language

English started of as a small language spoken by the inhabitants of an island in the middle of Europe. It later developed to consume the world within its omnipresent grasp. This has bought its upsides and downsides. The most prominent and useful upside is that it has become thw worlds greatest and most developed `lingua franca`. This means that english being the bridge over the great crevasse that is lingual conversation. An example, a swede and a spaniard are negotiating a big business deal where correct communication is crucial. Neither of them know the other parties language. They would not default to japanese. No, they would most likely end up speaking english. But how did it get this way? How did a language originating from such an arbitrary location end up conquering the world. Well to answer that question we need to go back to the island.

English wasn't conceived in England. Instead germanic tribes brought with them a primitive version of the language while they invading the region now known as southern England. This would them be added upon by Nordic vikings. Throughout their pillages they brought with somewhere in the region of 2000 new words. This would immensely speed up the already rapid growth and development of the english language. In later times words like for example sky in english and sky in Norwegian will diverge but it is obvious that they come from the same root. This combined with a fresh french administration and juristical system would come together and create the earliest form of the english language.

Great internal communication combined with good external relationships come together to kickstart the british empire. The empire would then start to spread across the world slowly but steadily leading to it becoming the greatest and most extensive empire in history. With this equipped as its weapon of choice the patient zero of britain will begin to infect its next hosts with the english language. Spreading out the empire would assimilate India, the later to be United States, Australia and many more. Erecting new colonies faster than one can say antidisestablishmentarianism the spores of English would start to grow inside its victims. Each of these would consequently introduce new words to the english vocabulary that would then spread around the rest of the empire. Assisted by the invention of the printing press this would increase the influence of the english language by many orders of magnitude.

All the while the world introduced english their language english would have its own internal inflation. William Shakespeare. Commonly refereed to as the greatest writer and playwright within the english language; William would introduced new words as he pleased. He may of created them himself or someone may have introduced them to him. Most likely a combination of them bought. Many of his words are still used in english today. For example control or addiction. With assistance from the printing press his works wore committed to history to be dissected for centuries to come.

Throughout all this the english language has started to flourished. Contrary of the british empire that was on a steep decline. Firstly the US declared its independence. Quickly proceeded by india and others. While the british empire was on a slippery slope back to nonexistence the language was not. The language started to mutate in new and fascinating ways. One of the most intreating ones being capitalism. By introducing a `pay per character` model for advertisements the US had essentially started to minimize english down to its bare minimums. This means dropping unnecessary us and replacing unintuitive spellings and instead writhing them almost phonetically. These are just some of the countless changes the different nations did to make english their own.

After such an eventful history of creation and destruction theres no wonder to why english is so widely spoken. It has so many influences that almost anything you can articulate in its component languages you can articulate in english. This combined by being enforced by law in many parts of the worlds leads to its widespread nature and power in international relations.
