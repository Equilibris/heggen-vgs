# Politically accepted racism

We live in a society that is the direct result of the effects of the slave trade throughout earlier generations. It started with the English forcing Africans to immigrate to America against their will as slaves. This is mutually agreed upon as one of the greatest tragedies throughout history. This is based upon the systemized xenophobia and racism against the slaves; they were treated like cattle &mdash; inhuman living conditions, long days with low to zero wages, and when faced with defective units’ euthanasia was the simplest option. This leads to the modern-day loathing against racism &mdash; where even the slightest hint of racial prejudice can one's immediate dismissal. Based on these facts one would be surprised to find out that there are still situations where xenophobia is politically accepted.

First, let us define racism as a subset of xenophobia (derived from the Greek word Xenos meaning stranger or foreigner and phobos meaning fear so the fear of the unknown or foreign). Or in other words. Racism is a form of misunderstanding or lack of sympathy for other ethnic groups, countries, or their inhabitants. With this definition, we could easily say: ’prohibiting a specific ethnic group from entering a country, culture or work force’ is racist since it displays prejudice against a said ethnic group. But would we then define blockading immigrants from entering one's country based only upon the fact that they are a different ethnic group? Now this question is much more complex, why? Since politicians and their supporters have rational and logically based arguments yet still some people may state this as racist. On basis of these parties let us coin some terms, pro-assimilation is the name we will give people wishing to allow immigrants to assimilate into society, and on the contrary pro-structure standing for the purity of one's cultural believes. Of course, blindly following a definition can yield unexpected results so let us look at some of the arguments supporting pro-structure's theory first.

Pro-structure as stated in the name stands for keeping a culture immigration law structured and even. They believe that everyone should stand on an equal basis for immigrating into a country &mdash; and this basis is legally documented migration. This means that the transfer of a migrant is directly popped and appended from the country of origin's census to the new country of destination's census. This means that they will directly transfer from one country to another hence making the citizenship approval process orders of magnitude simpler. This is rational but does not cater to for example a refugee fleeing their country of origin since they would statistically not have access to the required legal documents. This means that pro-structure parties wish to reduce illegal immigration since this goes against its founding basis of equal ground for integration.

Another reason why pro-structure parties wish to reduce refugee or illegal immigration is they want to maintain a structure within the working force salary and work distribution. This is because an influx of refugee immigrants can disrupt the balance between different fields of work in the country of destination. An example of this could be a developing country is thrust into war and conflict leading to an immense increase in refugees. Since the country is developing the requirements within the workforce will be more closely oriented towards hard, physical labor over something like for example novel problem-solving. This means that the countries of destination would have to cater towards the great increase in physical labor sectors disrupting the previous structure and leading to the potential of a wave of unemployment.

On the other end of the spectrum, we have pro-assimilation parties. These parties have a more humanitarian basis for their beliefs. They believe that every human should have an equal chance of assimilating into a given culture and should be scanned for their strengths and abilities and not their history. This means that they believe that upon a refugee attempting to enter a country they should be assisted, cared for, and helped assimilate into the culture of the country of destination &mdash; instead of being deported back into that, that would be almost certain death or suffering. These beliefs stand for life over death, assistance over exclusion, and assimilation over alienation. Everyone can agree these morals are good. But do they work well in practice?

Replicating the previous scenario from the pro-structure example we will now analyze the effects of an unexpected boom in the number of refugees. Pro-assimilation values excel when it comes to a long-term constant stream of immigrants. When faced with an unforeseen proliferation of refugees. This leads to an intriguing dilemma. Ether let the refugees seek asylum within the pro-assimilation country of destination and let the impact reverberate throughout the economy, the working force structure, and the general population, or one could reduce the number of accepted refugees at the cost of long-term accepting more. This choice must be evaluated rigorously upon each separate scenario since there is no objectively correct choice.

To sum up: whilst pro-structure believes are xenophobic in nature since they discriminate a specific ethnic group from entering a country based on their survival and situation whilst pro-assimilation believes are morally best and the correct solution for a perfect world, unfortunately, our world is flawed and by definition not perfect. This leads to another question within itself: should we condone xenophobic behavior based only on subjective arguments surrounding the belief that they are doing the correct thing? To this, the answer is no. Everyone thinks there doing the right thing even though they are objectively straying from that ideology. Therefore, I would recommend a more optimistic view upon the strengths of refugees. View them for what they are, humans, and what are humans best at? Developing, assimilating, and solving new and rising problems within the society they have entered.

# Acceptance of the truth

What does it mean to belong? Does it mean we are surrounded by an environment that accepts and stimulates us? Does it mean we have the chance to flourish surrounded by people that drive and motivate us? Or is it simply being allowed to exist without being pursued and harassed. These definitions are very different, they are on a spectrum based on the current wellbeing of the beholder. Will an immigrant really feel a sense of belonging if they are not welcome?

Let us first state the fact that the word immigrant is mutilated and twisted by modern society. What do i mean with this? Well when politicians talk about reducing the quantity of immigrants they are not talking about legal immigrants, they are talking about refugees being thrust out of their country of origin and into a world of great uncertainty and dissonance. Here, in there new world they need to learn the hard rules of developed, hardened, and impassive countries. Countries like Australia that simply do not want them there. They might even send them back to their minacious war-zone and prior home; country of origin &mdash; leading to immeasurable suffering.

Their endless track may not be to waste though. They may be accepted. Acceptance is objectively the greatest outcome. This means they are safe, for now at least. Their next journey is just around the corner; integrating into society. After migrating and being accepted comes the next hurdle for these immigrants, people do not want them there. Depending on the countries standing they may ether despise refugees wishing to save their life to such a degree that they construct monolithic walls, obliterating any sign of hope within the refugee populous. Others may even welcome them into an asylum with a roof over their head, electricity and a position in the school system or workforce. The sheer shread of hope is enough to motivate a refugee to seek life and not suffering.

The greatest challenge a migrant may face after war is by far assimilation. How can they become one when the one of the parts is actively steering away from it. Even if they are accepted in ( which is an issue within itself ) the inhabitants of said country may not want them there. This leads back to xenophobia &mdash; as in the populous does not wish for a non-ethnically identical subculture. In simpler terms, the population with be racist against the refugees from within its jarring nature. This means this challenge is not only comprised of politics but also prejudice.

To sum up. There are many aspects of a
