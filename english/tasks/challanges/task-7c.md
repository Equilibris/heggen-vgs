# Politically accepted racism

We live in a society that is the direct result of the effects of the slave trade throughout earlier generations. It started with the English forcing Africans to immigrate to America against their will as slaves. This is mutually agreed upon as one of the greatest tragedies throughout history. This is based upon the systemized xenophobia (derived from the Greek word Xenos meaning stranger or foreigner and phobos meaning fear so the fear of the unknown or foreign) and racism against the slaves; they were treated as cattle &mdash; inhuman living conditions, long days with low to zero wages and when faced with defective units euthanasia was the simplest option. This leads to the modern-day loathing against racism &mdash; where even the slightest hint of racial prejudice can one's immediate dismissal. Based on these facts one would be surprised to find out that there are still situations where xenophobia is politically accepted.

First, let us define racism as a subset of xenophobia. Or in other words. Racism is a form of misunderstanding or lack of sympathy for other ethnic groups, countries, or their inhabitants. With this definition, we could easily say: 'prohibiting a specific ethnic group from entering a country, culture or work force' is racist based on the fact that it displays prejudice against a said ethnic group. But would we then define blockading immigrants from entering one's country based only upon the fact that they are a different ethnic group? Now this question is much more complex, why? Since politicians and their supporters strictly believe that blockading them is the correct thing to do. Of course, blindly following a definition can yield unexpected results so let us take a look at some of the arguments supporting their theory.
