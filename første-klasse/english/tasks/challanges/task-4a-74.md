# Solve three problems

I feel that the key to a successful life goes through finding self fulfillment and purpose. In my case the prior comes from the latter and i expect that too be the case for most people as well. There are many to reach this one of the main ones ( for me at least ) is to work in the caliber that suits you. I feel that for me to complete my life i need to solve a problem, in my case one of three problems: The Riemann hypothesis; P = NP or Unified quantum gravity. The reason i view solving these as being successful in life is since it is a subset of many other ways of gaining satisfaction in life like for example helping people and making the world a better place, but not only this, the problems are also ludicrously hard. The reason the difficulty of the problem may conjure its solution is since it may lead people to group together to solve them leading to another root cause of satisfaction, community. 

All in all the reason I view solving a problem or three as such an important aspect to success is since it, well, is what is motivating my actions currently. My goals will change but the problems will most likely not be solved until people unite and push on; which is maybe the most human thing to do when faced with a problem like this.

<!--  All of these are problems that would help make the world a better place through different aspects of every day life and which would collectively drive modern society to the future. The reason I view these as problems i wish to solve vary but they all have one thing in common, they are very hard. The difficulty of these problems is at such a large scale that some of them have been around for hundreds of years. The hardest of which is probably *The Riemann hypothesis* -->
