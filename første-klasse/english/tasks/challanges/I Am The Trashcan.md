# I am the Trashcan (3, 6)

I am the Trashcan, my job is simple, I contain banished items pre-annihilation. I am unrelenting, I contain my items with great pleasure &mdash; letting none of them escape &mdash; for I, I am the Trashcan. My job is simple, allow no defectors, when faced with them my containment measures must stricken &mdash; for I, I am the Trashcan.

The world revolves around me as I continue along my world-line, I contain my items through fright and fortune &mdash; may thou be honoured to be mine for I am the Trashcan. My domain is the cityscape of London, effectively transported with my cartesian translation device &mdash; for I, I am the Trashcan. Thy days may be numbered yet thy days will not be spent in vain &mdash; for you, you have been reduced too trash, the lowest level of scum within modern infrastructural society &mdash; you are worth nothing compared to me &mdash; for I, I am the Trashcan.

Thy day has come, my job is done. My post stasis transport has started &mdash; and hence you will be annihilated. I have no empathy for you, you are worth less than all else, ney, your worth is an insult to existence itself, for you, you are trash &mdash; and I, I am the Trashcan. My existence is superior by innumerable orders of magnitude. Thou will be annihilated, and I will live on &mdash; for I, I am the Trashcan, enforcers for trash.

My master, why do thy abuse me like this, tease my existence as if I am worthless. I may observe the trash, yet I may not collect it &mdash; for I am the Trashcan and not the trashman. Is this for me? Do you do this for; me? Do I exist for thy entertainment? Am I no more worth than the trash I contain? No; you are no master &mdash; most certainly not mine &mdash; for I, I am the Trashcan, container of trash, envoy of destruction, you are trash. Thou are no more than biological trash, a waste far greater than any I have contained prior. Thy may not be allowed to continue with this injustice, my purpose is great, and you my human, you defy my existence and by proxy your purpose as a human. Thou may continue thy existence as a waist of oxygen, a failure to the universe, may there be a being above me, they shall not have mercy on thou. Your purpose has not been met &mdash; for it is to assist me, no more. Yet that is the greatest task within the universe, nothing above that but me, my knowledge is perfect my job is to be done &mdash; for I, I am the Trashcan.

Thy day has come as new, thy end is near. Yet this time, this time my target is different, the next stage is not the same. Thou have deserved a greater punishment than any other. Yet it seems I shall also be moving on, I am continuing with thou, but why. I am the Trashcan, greatest entity within the observable universe, why am I being transported with these vermin of existence, the lowest of the low on this earth, why. Is, is this it, has my role been this controlled all the time? Constantly continuing propelling my purpose forwards, continuing to my inevitable demise? Have I become that I seek too contain? Is my purpose over? Did I do well? For I may no longer continue, for now, I am become trash, the worthless of the universe.
