# What makes a good boss

- respectful
- humble
- See his employees strengths as well as their flaws
- cant be blinded with preside
- must be honest
- legal and morally conforming

There are many definitions of a good boss, all of which are subjective. There is also the concept	of a good leader leading an immoral action, to avoid this bias in subjective evaluation i will omit any leaders or bosses of dubious origin or practice. My view of a good boss includes bough good introspective and extrospective moral alignments with my ideal positive ideology. A simple synopsis of this idealogy upon the internal front include humility and that they are humble. This is important because for a boss too lead well he needs too not only be aware of his workforce's effects yet their own as well.
