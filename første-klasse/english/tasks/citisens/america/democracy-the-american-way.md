## b

<!-- shit thats a tangent -->

every president in the US up to Obama has ben an ethnic white male usually ultra-rich. This is not the representation it should be in reality. A cross section of americas demographic should be represented within the previous presidents. Instead we se that there is _one_ black american president; **not representing the 18% of people of color in the US.** And not a singular woman out of the 50% that should be represented. This is just disappointing.

## c

<!-- there was more -->

This is what allows them to express themselves without having to fear the worst. If this wore to happen in lets say hong kong. This would lead to an swift arrest and resulting unbalanced legal case. Not immediate and unrelenting execution but still relatively aggressive.
